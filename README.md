# AllergyWebApp  
  
**Valerie Martinez:**  
Worked on a simple menu prototype.  
Focused on making case 3 work, which implements the Tesseract OCR and Leptonica library.  
  
Will not run if Tesseract OCR and Leptonica library are not installed, so only works on my own machine.  
  
**To do for next Iteration:**  
The text that gets recognized by the engine will get compared to a list of known user allergies and search for any similarities and return to the user whether or not that food product is safe for consumption.
