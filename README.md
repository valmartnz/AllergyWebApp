## Iteration 1
**Valerie Martinez:**  
Worked on a simple menu prototype.  
Focused on making case 3 work, which implements the Tesseract OCR and Leptonica library.  
  
Will not run if Tesseract OCR and Leptonica library are not installed, so only works on my own machine.  
  

## Iteration 2
**All Authors:**
Worked on separate webpages based off the mockup from Iteration 1 as HTML files before converting them into PHP files.  

**To do for next Iteration:**  
Start implementing features of the website and join work from the backend to the frontend.
